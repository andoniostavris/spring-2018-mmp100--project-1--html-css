<h1Mf Doom </h1>
<p>My name is Andonios Tavris I was born in East Elmhurst,NY. One of my interest consist of the music genre of rap
also known as hiphop. My favorite is named Daniel Dumile also chnages his name through egos he is generally known as 
Mf Doom. His lyrical flow sounds and has many unique literary elements different in a way more advanced than others.</p>
